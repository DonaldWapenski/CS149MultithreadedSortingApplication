# CS149MultithreadedSortingApplication
This is the source code and report for the final project of CS149. It implements a multithreaded quicksort and mergesort and utilizes a threshold value to switch to a selection sort. It provides the capability to run large batches of sorts and vary the array size and threshold values. It uses parameters.properties for input and outputs average run times to output.csv.
The report delves into the results of running this code and compares the performance of quicksort and mergesort with different threshold values and array sizes.
